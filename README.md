# Bike Rental Prediction Using Linear Regression
## Abstract
Countries like Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, and many more, are popular for encourage eco-friendly transportation among society: electric cars, bycicle rental services, trolley cars, and so on.

This case study will be focused on how variables like feeling temperature and bike rentals are related to each other, i.e., how bike rentals increase or decrease according to variations in feeling temperature.

## How to use it
- open a console and place on project directory
- run `python main.py` <br><br>

For predictions it will ask:
- Do you wank to make predictions?
- How many predictions?
- N inputs to predict
